          <strong>My Story:</strong><br>
          I struggle with studying. I get distracted easily and I sometimes struggle to keep track with what all I need to do, how much time I need for it, and how much time I have already spent. I’ve tried using apps like Notion, the notes app on my phone, sticky notes (the physical ones stuck around my room and the one built-in on Windows), Notepad, Google Sheets. Nothing has worked for me. Nothing feels like it was made for students in mind.
